# Don't-Drink-and-Drive

*They see me rollin', they hatin'.*

Welcome to **Don't Drink and Drive**, the only racing game where the traffic is always against you and the only rule is to not become a pancake. Conceived by three brilliant minds who probably should have been working, this game is your chance to experience the thrill of a daily commute, but with more explosions (figuratively... for now).

## How to Play

The goal is simple: survive as long as you can without turning your car into a modern art installation.

*   **Arrow Keys:**
    *   `UP`: Accelerate (because who needs brakes?)
    *   `DOWN`: Decelerate (for the faint of heart)
    *   `LEFT`: Dodge left
    *   `RIGHT`: Dodge right
*   **Objective:** Weave through an endless onslaught of cars, trucks, and buses. The longer you last, the higher your score.
*   **Game Over:** If you crash, it's game over. Press `R` to restart your chaotic journey or `Q` to rage quit.

## Features

*   **Endless Mayhem:** The road never ends, and the traffic only gets angrier.
*   **Dynamic Difficulty:** The longer you survive, the faster and more numerous the obstacles become. It's like rush hour, but on steroids.
*   **Variety of Obstacles:** Dodge everything from speedy little cars to lumbering buses that have no regard for your personal space.
*   **High Score Tracking:** Compete with yourself to see how long you can last before you're just a memory on the asphalt.

## Developer Info

This masterpiece was brought to you by three developers who specialize in turning caffeine into code. We're not saying we're the best, but we're pretty sure this is how award-winning games get started.
